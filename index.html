  let text = "Tom and Jerry is a classic cat chases mouse plot. As a little kid you see all of these types of shows in a different perspective but when you actually view them with an adult mind set, you start seeing these subliminal messages that some people may find offensive or disturbing. Tom and Jerry is a typical show with basic stereotypes of different cultures for a mere laugh. While these may seem harmless and unintentional, they implant a non-focused picture of what a real life person, of this designated group, may look like. For example, the racism in “Tom and Jerry” is often shown when a character gets too close to an explosive, it goes off, and he turns up in blackface with big red lips. As I watched the show, not only did I notice some racism, but in the episodes seen, there were almost no female characters. If one did happen to pop up, it was to infatuate Tom or Jerry and distract from their current objective or purpose. Obviously if the female did catch their attention so easily, they had to be attractive in a way, but in the cartoons, they are attractive in every way! They was much sexualized with their red lips curling and spidery eyelashes incessantly batting as Tom and Jerry competed over them. They are skinny as all could be and had the body of a Victoria Secret Model, the perfect woman in short terms. Its ridiculous the way the males obsess over the females in old cartoon shows, but who can blame them? ";
